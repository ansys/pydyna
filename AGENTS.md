Assume an appropriate virtual environment is activated. If it isn't, just abort.

## Agent Hints

**CRITICAL: Never redirect output to /dev/null on Windows**. This triggers a VS Code security prompt that halts execution. Instead:
- For commands where you want to suppress output: Use `>$null 2>&1` (PowerShell) or just run the command without redirection
- For commands where you want to check output: Use `python codegen/generate.py 2>&1 | Out-Null` or capture in a variable
- For checking if a command succeeded: Just run it normally and check `$?` or `$LASTEXITCODE`
- Examples:
  - ❌ BAD: `python codegen/generate.py >/dev/null 2>&1`
  - ✅ GOOD: `python codegen/generate.py >$null 2>&1`
  - ✅ GOOD: `python codegen/generate.py` (no redirection)
  - ✅ GOOD: `$output = python codegen/generate.py 2>&1`

## Agent Coding Style Preferences

- Do not use inline comments to explain imports. Instead, use a module-level docstring to indicate the purpose and usage of imported modules. This applies to all agent-generated code, not just codegen modules.
- There is a line limit of 120 characters, and other linting rules. Use precommit run --all-files to run the linters after makin changes.
- **Do not mark items in `codegen/todo.md` as "COMPLETED"**. This is a living document of architectural recommendations, not a task tracker. When implementing recommendations, document the implementation in the appropriate `agents/*.md` guide file instead.
- **Add comprehensive logging**: Use Python's `logging` module extensively throughout the codebase. Add a logger instance (`logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`) to each module and use it liberally:
  - Use `logger.debug()` for detailed traceability of execution flow, variable values, and decisions
  - Use `logger.info()` for high-level progress updates and successful operations
  - Use `logger.warning()` for recoverable issues or unexpected conditions
  - Use `logger.error()` for failures with `exc_info=True` to include stack traces
  - Replace any `print()` statements with appropriate logging calls
  - Log function entry/exit for complex operations, parameter values, counts, and decision points

Run `pre-commit run --all-files` after changes

## Agent Guides

Detailed documentation for common tasks and patterns:

- **[agents/linked_keywords.md](agents/linked_keywords.md)**: How to expose relationships between keywords (e.g., DefineTable → DefineCurve) using properties and import handlers.
- **[agents/codegen.md](agents/codegen.md)**: How to work with auto-generated keyword classes and create manual subclasses for customizations.

## Notes on the Keyword Submodule

### Code Generation Handler System

The keyword class generator uses a **handler pipeline** to transform keyword metadata from the JSON schema into Python classes. See `agents/codegen.md` for detailed documentation.

**Key Principles**:
1. **Execution order matters** - handlers are executed in registration order (see `registry.py`)
2. **Reference semantics** - handlers like `card-set` and `table-card-group` use references, not deep copies
3. **In-place mutations** - later handlers modify cards that earlier handlers referenced
4. **Index vs. position** - after reordering, use list positions not the card's `index` property

**Common Pitfall**: Using `copy.deepcopy()` when grouping cards breaks the generation because later handlers' modifications won't appear in the groups.

### Deck Import Handlers

Deck registers import handlers (e.g., `DefineTableProcessor`) and runs them during `Deck.loads()` and include expansion. Handlers see keywords as they are imported and should only assume immediate neighbor context unless explicitly coded otherwise.

For detailed guidance on linking keywords, see [agents/linked_keywords.md](agents/linked_keywords.md).

### Auto-Generated Keywords

The files in `src/ansys/dyna/core/keywords/keyword_classes/auto/` are auto-generated by Jinja templates. If they need to be modified, update the codegen system. If modifications are not straightforward to add to codegen, create a manual subclass instead.

For detailed guidance on working with auto-generated files, see [agents/codegen.md](agents/codegen.md).
