# Contributing

Repositories should have a contributing section, but we don't need to have all the contributing information here.  Have them reference the developer guide.

We absolutely welcome any code contributions and we hope that this
guide will facilitate an understanding of the TEMPLATE code
repository. It is important to note that while the TEMPLATE software
package is maintained by ANSYS and any submissions will be reviewed
thoroughly before merging, we still seek to foster a community that can
support user questions and develop new features to make this software
a useful tool for all users.  As such, we welcome and encourage any
questions or submissions to this repository.

Please reference the [PyAnsys Developer's
Guide](https://github.com/pyansys/about) for the full documentation
regarding contributing to the TEMPLATE project.
