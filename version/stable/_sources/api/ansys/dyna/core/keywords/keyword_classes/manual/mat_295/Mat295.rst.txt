   Bases: :py:obj:`ansys.dyna.core.keywords.keyword_classes.auto.mat.mat_295.Mat295`


   
   MAT_295 keyword with before_read support for self-referential conditionals.

   This subclass adds peek-ahead logic to detect ANISO and ACTIVE title cards
   before reading, allowing the conditional cards to be properly activated.

   .. py:method:: before_read(buf: TextIO) -> None

      
      Peek into the buffer before reading to activate conditional cards.

      The ANISO and ACTIVE cards need to be activated before reading because
      their conditional functions depend on atype and actype values which
      are read from those very cards. This method peeks ahead to find these
      title lines and pre-sets the fields.
