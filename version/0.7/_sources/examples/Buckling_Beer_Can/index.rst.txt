Note: due to `https://github.com/ansys/pydyna/issues/583`, this example is not available in
the documentation. But it can be found in the code at
`https://github.com/ansys/pydyna/tree/main/examples/Buckling_Beer_Can`

.. This example is adapted from `https://lsdyna.ansys.com/example-nonlinear-2/` to run from
.. Python. It is a highly nonlinear problem that whose solution will not fully converge, but
.. that is expected.
