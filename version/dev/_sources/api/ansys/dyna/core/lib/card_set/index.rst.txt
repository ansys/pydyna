ansys.dyna.core.lib.card_set
============================

.. py:module:: ansys.dyna.core.lib.card_set

.. autoapi-nested-parse::

   Set of cards that act as one card.

   It is a generic card, so it needs to be given a type as an argument.
   That type is used for each card, and behaves like a keyword.

   Help with handling card sets.

   For convenience the first card set can be manipulated by the keyword
   if it is currently empty. Getters, on the other hand, only work if
   a card set has been added.
