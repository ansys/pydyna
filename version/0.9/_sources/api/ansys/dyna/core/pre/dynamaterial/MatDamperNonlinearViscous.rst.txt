ansys.dyna.core.pre.dynamaterial.MatDamperNonlinearViscous
==========================================================

.. py:class:: ansys.dyna.core.pre.dynamaterial.MatDamperNonlinearViscous(curve)

   
   Provides a viscous translational damper with an arbitrary force.

   The arbitrary force is defined as a function of velocity dependency or a rotational
   damper with an arbitrary moment as a function of rotational velocity dependency.

   :Parameters:

       **curve** : :obj:`Curve`
           Load curve defining force as a function of rate-of-displacement
           relationship or a moment as a function of rate-of-rotation relationship.
