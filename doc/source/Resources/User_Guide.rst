There are 3 related packages here, all under the ansys/dyna/ directory.

PyDyna-pre provides interface to create DYNA input deck.

PyDyna-solver contains code for interfacing with the LS-DYNA solver directly.
As LS-DYNA is primarily a batch solver with very limited interactive
capabilities, the code here is similarly limited.  The target
use case is that LS-DYNA will be running in a container environment
such as Docker or Kubernetes.  The code here then allows for pushing
input files to the container, starting LS-DYNA and monitoring its
progress, and retrieving results files.

The Data Processing Framework (DPF) is designed to provide numerical
simulation users/engineers with a toolbox for accessing and
transforming simulation data. DPF can access data from solver result
files as well as several neutral formats (csv, hdf5, vtk,
etc.). Various operators are available allowing the manipulation and
the transformation of this data.

The Python `ansys-dpf-post` package provides a simplified Python
interface to DPF, thus enabling rapid postprocessing without ever
leaving a Python environment. 

Visit the [DPF-Post Documentation](https://postdocs.pyansys.com) for a
detailed description of the package
