          * - :py:attr:`~mid`
            - Get or set the Material identification. A unique number has to be used.
          * - :py:attr:`~ro`
            - Get or set the Mass density.
          * - :py:attr:`~e`
            - Get or set the Young's modulus.
          * - :py:attr:`~lcid`
            - Get or set the Load curve ID, see *DEFINE_CURVE, for nominal stress versus strain.
          * - :py:attr:`~tc`
            - Get or set the Tension cut-off stress.
          * - :py:attr:`~hu`
            - Get or set the Hysteretic unloading factor between 0 and 1 (default = 1.0, no energy dissipation).
          * - :py:attr:`~beta`
            - Get or set the Decay constant to model creep in unloading.
          * - :py:attr:`~damp`
            - Get or set the Viscous coefficient (0.05 < recommended value < 0.50) to model damping effects.
          * - :py:attr:`~shape`
            - Get or set the Shape factor for unloading. Active for nonzero values of the hysteretic unloading factor. Values less than one reduces the energy dissipation and greater than one increases dissipation.
          * - :py:attr:`~fail`
            - Get or set the Failure option after cutoff stress is reached:
          * - :py:attr:`~bvflag`
            - Get or set the Bulk viscosity activation flag:
          * - :py:attr:`~ed`
            - Get or set the Optional Young's relaxation modulus, Ed, for rate effects.
          * - :py:attr:`~beta1`
            - Get or set the Optional decay constant.
          * - :py:attr:`~kcon`
            - Get or set the Stiffness coefficient for contact interface stiffness. Maximum slope in stress vs. strain curve is used. When the maximum slope is taken for the contact, the time step size for this material is reduced for stability. In some cases delta-t may be significantly smaller, and defining a reasonable stiffness is recommended.
          * - :py:attr:`~ref`
            - Get or set the Use reference geometry to initialize the stress tensor, see also *INITIAL_FOAM_REFERENCE_ GEOMETRY. Ls-dyna now supports not only 8 noded elements. Per manual it supports Elfom= 1,2,10,15..
          * - :py:attr:`~title`
            - Get or set the Additional title line
