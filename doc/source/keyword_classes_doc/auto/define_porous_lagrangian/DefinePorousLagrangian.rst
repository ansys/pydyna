.. py:property:: eidbeg
   :type: Optional[int]


   
   Get or set the EIDBEG, EIDEND > 0: Range of thick porous element IDs. These are solids in 3D and shells in 2D.
   EIDBEG, EIDEND < 0: Range of thin porous element IDs.   These are shells in 3D and beams in 2D.
   The ALE option does not support thin porous elements.
   EIDBEG > 0, EIDEND = 0: EIDBEG is a set of thick porous
   elements
   EIDBEG > 0, EIDEND < 0: EIDBEG is a set of thin porous elements.

   Get or set the EIDBEG, EIDEND > 0: Range of thick porous element IDs. These are solids in 3D and shells in 2D.
   EIDBEG, EIDEND < 0: Range of thin porous element IDs.   These are shells in 3D and beams in 2D.
   The ALE option does not support thin porous elements.
   EIDBEG > 0, EIDEND = 0: EIDBEG is a set of thick porous
   elements
   EIDBEG > 0, EIDEND < 0: EIDBEG is a set of thin porous elements.

.. py:property:: local
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Flag to activate an element coordinate system:
   EQ.0: The forces are applied in the global directions.
   EQ.1: The forces are applied in a local system attached to the
   element. The system is consistent with DIREC = 1 and
   CTYPE = 12 in *CONSTRAINED_LAGRANGE_IN_SOLID.
   For CTYPE = 11, LOCAL is always 1 and the 洧논-axis is
   aligned with the element normal while the 洧녽-axis passes
   through the element center and the first node in the element
   connectivity (*ELEMENT_BEAM in 2D or *ELEMENT_SHELL in 3D).

.. py:property:: vecid1
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the *DEFINE_VECTOR IDs to define a specific coordinate system. VECID1
   and VECID2 give the 洧논- and 洧녽-direction respectively. The 洧녾-
   vector is a cross product of VECID1 and VECID2. If this latter is not
   orthogonal to VECID1, its direction will be corrected with a crossproduct
   of 洧녾- and 洧논-vectors. The vectors are stored as isoparametric
   locations to update their directions if the element deforms or rotates.
