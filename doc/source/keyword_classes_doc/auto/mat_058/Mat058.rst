.. py:property:: lcdfail
   :type: Optional[int]


   
   Get or set the Load-Curve ID, that defines orientation dependent failure strains.
   The ordinate values in the load-curve define the various failure strains, in the following order:
   1. EF_11T: tensile failure strain in longitudinal a-direction
   2. EF_11C: compressive failure strain in longitudinal a-direction
   3. EF_22T: tensile failure strain in transverse b-direction
   4. EF_22C: compressive failure strain in transverse b-direction
   5. EF_12: in-plane shear failure strain in ab-plane
   6. EF_33T: tensile failure strain in transverse c-direction
   7. EF_33C: compressive failure strain in transverse c-direction
   8. EF_23: out-of plane shear failure strain in bc-plane
   9. EF_31: out-of plane shear failure strain in ca-plane
   Thus, the load-curve to define these values has to have either 5 (shells) or 9 (solids) entries in its definition.
   A load-curve definition with 9 entries may be used for shells, ignoring the last 4 entries. The abscissa values are ignored.
