.. py:property:: fr_mmg
   :type: Optional[int]


   
   Get or set the This is the AMMG-SID before the switch. The AMMG-SID
   corresponds to the SID defined on a *SET_MULTI-MATERIAL_GROUP_LIST (SMMGL) card.
   This SID refers to one or more AMMGs.

.. py:property:: to_mmg
   :type: Optional[int]


   
   Get or set the This is the AMMG-SID after the switch. The AMMG-SID
   corresponds to the SID defined on a *SET_MULTI-MATERIAL_GROUP_LIST (SMMGL) card.
   This SID refers to one or more AMMGs.

.. py:property:: idfunc
   :type: Optional[int]


   
   Get or set the ID of a *DEFINE_FUNCTION function. This function determines
   the material fraction to be switched.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: idsegset
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the ID of *SEGMENT_SET that is used to pass geometric properties to
   the function specified by IDFUNC. This field is optional.
   The segment center positions and normal vectors are computed.
   For each ALE element, this data is passed to the function
   IDFUNC for the segment the closest to the element center.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: idsldset
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the The ID of a *SOLID_SET specifying which elements are affected
   by this particular instance of the *ALE_SWITCH_MMG keyword.
   This field is optional. If undefined, *ALE_SWITCH_MMG affects
   all ALE elements. The element centers are computed and can be
   used as variables in the function IDFUNC.

.. py:property:: ncycseg
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Number of cycles between each update of the segment centers
   and normal vectors (if a segment set is defined). For each update,
   a bucket sort is applied to find the closest segment to each ALE
   element. If the segment nodes are fully constrained, the segment
   centers and normal vectors are computed only one time.
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: ncycsld
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Number of cycles between each update of the ALE element
   centers. For each update, a bucket sort is applied to find the
   closest segment to each ALE element. If the element nodes does
   not move (as with AFAC = -1 in *CONTROL_ALE) the element
   centers are computed exactly once.
