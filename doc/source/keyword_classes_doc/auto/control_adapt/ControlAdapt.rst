Property detail

.. py:property:: adpfreq
   :type: Optional[float]


   
   Get or set the Time interval between adaptive refinements.

.. py:property:: adptol
   :type: float


   
   Get or set the Adaptive error tolerance in degrees for ADPOPT set to 1 or 2 below. If ADPOPT is set to 8, ADPTOL is the characteristic element size (default = 1.0E+20).
















   ..
       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: adptyp
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Adaptive options:
   EQ.1: angle change in degrees per adaptive refinement relative to the surrounding elements for each element to be refined (default).
   EQ.2: total angle change in degrees relative to the surrounding element for each element to be refined.
   Adapts when the shell error in the energy norm, Î”e, exceeds ADPTOL/100 times the mean energy norm within the part.
   EQ.7: 3D r-adaptive remeshing for solid elements.  Tetrahedrons are used in the adaptive remeshing process (solid formulation 10 or 13, or if EFG, formulation 42), or in the case of 3D axisymmetry (orbital) adaptivity, hexahedral and pentahedral elements are used in the adaptive remeshing.  A completely new mesh is generated which is initialized from the old mesh using a least squares approximation.  The mesh size is currently based on the minimum and maximum edge lengths defined on the *CONTROL_REMESHING keyword input.  This option remains under development, and we are not sure of its reliability on complex geometries.
   EQ.8/-8: 2D r-adaptive remeshing for plane stress, plane strain, and axisymmetric continuum elements,that is, shell formulations 12 through 15.
   A completely new mesh is generated which is initialized from the old mesh using a least squares approximation.
   The mesh size is currently based on the value, ADPTOL, which gives the characteristic element size.
   This option is based on earlier work by Dick and Harris[1992].
   If ADPTYP is negative, then self-contacting material will not be merged together.
   The self-merging is often preferred since it eliminates sharp folds in the boundary;
   however, if the sharp fold is being simulated, unexpected results are generated.
