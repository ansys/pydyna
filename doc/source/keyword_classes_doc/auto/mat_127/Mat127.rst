          * - :py:attr:`~mid`
            - Get or set the Material identification. A unique number has to be used.
          * - :py:attr:`~ro`
            - Get or set the Mass density.
          * - :py:attr:`~k`
            - Get or set the Bulk modulus.
          * - :py:attr:`~g`
            - Get or set the Shear modulus.
          * - :py:attr:`~n`
            - Get or set the Number of statistical links.
          * - :py:attr:`~lcid`
            - Get or set the Optional load curve ID of relaxation curve.
          * - :py:attr:`~tramp`
            - Get or set the Optional ramp time for loading.
          * - :py:attr:`~nt`
            - Get or set the Number of Prony series terms in optional fit. Currently, the maximum number is 6. Values less than 6, possibly 3-5 are recommended, since each term used adds significantly to the cost. Default is set to 6. Caution should be exercised when taking the results from the fit. Always check the results of the fit in the output file. Preferably, all generated coefficients should be positive. Negative values may lead to unstable results. Once a satisfactory fit has been achieved it is recommended that the coefficients which are written into the output file be input in future runs.
          * - :py:attr:`~gi`
            - Get or set the Optional shear relaxation modulus for the i'th term. Define up to six cards
          * - :py:attr:`~betai`
            - Get or set the Optional decay constant for the i'th term.
          * - :py:attr:`~title`
            - Get or set the Additional title line
