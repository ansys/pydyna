.. py:property:: unconv
   :type: Optional[float]


   
   Get or set the Unit conversion factor. UCONV = SQRT (1psi in the model stress units).
   This is needed because the ultimate tensile stress of concrete is expessed as SQRT(fc') where fc' is in psi. Therefore a unit conversion factor of sqrt(psi/stress unit) is required.

   Example:
   UCONV =0.083 if stress unit is MN/m2 or N/mm2
   UCONV = 83.3 if stress unit is N/m2
