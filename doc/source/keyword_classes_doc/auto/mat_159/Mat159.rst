   EQ. 1: Maximum of brittle and ductile damage (default).
   EQ. 2: Maximum of brittle and ductile damage, with recovery of  brittle damage.
   EQ. 3:  Brittle damage.
   EQ. 4:  Ductile damage.

.. py:property:: irate
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Rate effects options:
   EQ.   0: Rate effects model turned off (default).

.. py:property:: erode
   :type: Optional[float]


   
   Get or set the Elements erode when damage exceeds 0.99 and the maximum principal strain exceeds 1.-ERODE.   For erosion that is independent of strain, set ERODE equal to 1.0.   Erosion does not occur if ERODE is less than 1.0.

.. py:property:: recov
   :type: float


   
   Get or set the The modulus is recovered in compression when RECOV is equal to 0 (default).  The modulus remains at the brittle damage level when RECOV is equal to 1.  Partial recovery is modeled for values of RECOV between 0 and 1.  Two options are available:
   Option 1:  Input a value between 0 and 1.  Recovery is based upon the sign of the pressure invariant only.
   Option 2:  Input a value between 10 and 11.  Recovery is based upon the sign of both the pressure and volumetric strain.    In this case, RECOV=RECOV-10, and a flag is set to request the volumetric strain check.
