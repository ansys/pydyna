          * - :py:attr:`~mid`
            - Get or set the Material identification. A unique number has to be used.

            - Get or set the Mass density.

            - Get or set the Bulk modulus.

            - Get or set the Material coefficient.
          * - :py:attr:`~delta`
            - Get or set the delta, material coefficient.
          * - :py:attr:`~alpha`
            - Get or set the alpha, material coefficient.

            - Get or set the beta, material coefficient.

            - Get or set the Material coefficient.
          * - :py:attr:`~c2`
            - Get or set the Material coefficient.
          * - :py:attr:`~lcid`
            - Get or set the Optional load curve ID of relaxation curve.
          * - :py:attr:`~tramp`
            - Get or set the Optional ramp time for loading.
          * - :py:attr:`~nt`
            - Get or set the Number of Prony series terms in optional fit. Default is 6. Possibly 3-5 are recommended, since each term used adds significantly to the cost. Always check the results of the fit in the output file. Preferably, all generated coefficients should be positive. Negative values may lead to unstable results. Once a satisfactory fit has been achieved it is recommended that the coefficients which are written into the output file be input in future runs.
          * - :py:attr:`~gi`
            - Get or set the Optional shear relaxation modulus for the  first term. Define up to six cards.
          * - :py:attr:`~betai`
            - Get or set the Optional decay constant if ith term. Define up to six cards.
          * - :py:attr:`~title`
            - Get or set the Additional title line
