Depending on if a chamber is defined, how the local part pressures are evaluated changes (see *DEFINE_CPM_CHAMBER).

   When a chamber is defined, specifying PID1and PID2 causes the vent probability function to be evaluated from the difference of local part pressures between PID1and PID2.Otherwise the calculation involves the chamber pressure.This option is usually used for vents near a long sleeve which causes unrealistic venting using chamber pressure alone.
   When a chamber is not defined, the vent probability function is evaluated from the difference of local part pressures between PID1and PID2, using the location of the part centers to help determine vent direction..If the part is an external part, the part pressure will be used.If the part is an internal part, the pressure on the shellâ€™s positive normal side will be used.If the vent is an external vent, PID1 should be the same as PID2 to avoid input error.
