            - Get or set the Bulk modulus.
          * - :py:attr:`~lcpv`
            - Get or set the Load curve ID for pressure versus volumetric strain. Defined in compression only. The sign convention requires that both pressure and compressive strain be defined as positive values where the compressive strain is taken as the negative value of the natural logrithm of the relative volume.

            - Get or set the Load curve ID for yield versus pressure:
          * - :py:attr:`~lcfp`
            - Get or set the Load curve ID for plastic strain at which fracture begins versus pressure.  This load curve ID must be defined if B>0.0.
          * - :py:attr:`~lcrp`
            - Get or set the Load curve ID for plastic strain at which residual strength is reached versus pressure. This load curve ID must be defined if B>0.0.
          * - :py:attr:`~pc`
            - Get or set the Pressure cutoff for tensile fracture
