          * - :py:attr:`~mid`
            - Get or set the Material identification. A unique number has to be used.
          * - :py:attr:`~ro`
            - Get or set the Mass density.
          * - :py:attr:`~g`
            - Get or set the Shear modulus.
          * - :py:attr:`~sigy`
            - Get or set the Yield stress.
          * - :py:attr:`~eh`
            - Get or set the Plastic hardening modulus.
          * - :py:attr:`~pc`
            - Get or set the Pressure cutoff (<= 0.0).
          * - :py:attr:`~fs`
            - Get or set the Failure strain for erosion.
          * - :py:attr:`~charl`
            - Get or set the Characteristic element thickness for deletion.  This applies to 2D solid elements that lie on a boundary of a part.  If the boundary element thins down due to stretching or compression, and if it thins to a value less than CHARL, the element will be deleted.  The primary application of this option is to predict the break-up of axisymmetric shaped charge jets.
          * - :py:attr:`~eps1`
            - Get or set the First effective plastic strain point (True). Define up to 16 values. Care must be taken that the full range of strains expected in the analysis is covered. Linear extrapolation is used if the strain values exceed the maximum input value.
