          * - :py:attr:`~ro`
            - Get or set the Mass density.
          * - :py:attr:`~roflg`
            - Get or set the Flag for whether density is specified per unit area or volume:
          * - :py:attr:`~intfail`
            - Get or set the The number of integration points required for the cohesive element to be deleted. The value of INTFAIL may range from 1 to 4 with 1 the recommended value.
          * - :py:attr:`~tes`
            - Get or set the Type of effective separation parameter (ESP).
          * - :py:attr:`~tslc`
            - Get or set the Normalized traction-separation load curve ID. The curve must be normalized in both coordinates and must contain at least three points: (0.0, 0.0), (lambda_0, 1.0), and (1.0, 0.0), which represents the origin, the peak and the complete failure, respectively (see Figure 186.1). A platform can exist in the curve like the tri-linear TSLC (see MAT_185).
          * - :py:attr:`~gic`
            - Get or set the Fracture toughness / energy release rate   for mode I.

            - Get or set the Fracture toughness / energy release rate   for mode II.
          * - :py:attr:`~xmu`
            - Get or set the Exponent that appears in the power failure criterion (TES=1.0) or the Benzeggagh-Kenane failure criterion (TES=2.0). Recommended values for XMU are between 1.0 and 2.0.
          * - :py:attr:`~t`
            - Get or set the Peak traction in normal direction (mode I).
          * - :py:attr:`~s`
            - Get or set the Peak traction in tangential direction (mode II).
          * - :py:attr:`~stfsf`
            - Get or set the Penetration stiffness multiplier for compression. Factor = (1.0+STFSF) is used to scale the compressive stiffness, i.e. no scaling is done with STFSF=0.0 (recommended).
          * - :py:attr:`~tslc2`
            - Get or set the Normalized traction-separation load curve ID for Mode II. The curve must be normalized in both coordinates and must contain at least three points: (0.0,0.0), (λ_0,1.0), and (1.0,0.0), which represents the origin, the peak and the complete failure, respectively. If not specified, TSLC is used for Mode II behavior as well
