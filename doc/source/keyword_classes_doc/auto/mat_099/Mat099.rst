          * - :py:attr:`~mid`
            - Get or set the Material identification. A unique number has to be used.

            - Get or set the Mass density.

            - Get or set the Formulation for rate effects
          * - :py:attr:`~eppfr`
            - Get or set the Plastic strain at which material ruptures(logrithmic).

            - Get or set the Load curve ID defining nonlinear damage curve.
          * - :py:attr:`~numint`
            - Get or set the Number of through thickness integration points which must fail before the element is deleted. (If zero, all points must fail.) The default of all integration points is not recommended since elements undergoing large strain are often not deleted due to nodal fiber rotations which limit strains at active integration points after most points have failed. Better results are obtained if NUMINT is set to 1 or a number less than one half of the number of through thickness points. For example, if four through thickness points are used, NUMINT should not exceed 2, even for fully integrated shells which have 16 integration points.
          * - :py:attr:`~a`
            - Get or set the Input constants.

            - Get or set the Effective plastic strain at failure.
          * - :py:attr:`~sigmax`
            - Get or set the Maximum stress obtainable from work hardening, before rate effects are added(optional). This option is ignored if VP=1.0.
          * - :py:attr:`~sigsat`
            - Get or set the Saturation stress which limits the maximum value of effective stress which can develop after rate effects are added.(optional)
          * - :py:attr:`~epso`
            - Get or set the Effective plastic strain rate. This value depends on the time units. Typically input 1 for units of seconds, 0.001 for units of milliseconds, 0.000001 for microseconds, etc.
