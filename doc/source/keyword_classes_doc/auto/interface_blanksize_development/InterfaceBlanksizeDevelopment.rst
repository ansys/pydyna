.. py:property:: ioption
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Target definition input type:
   EQ.1: (entire) blank mesh in keyword format.
   EQ.2: consecutive position coordinates of blank boundary loop
   curve in XYZ format. Blank geometry is located to the left side of the
   looped curve, as shown in Remarks below.

.. py:property:: iadapt
   :type: Optional[int]


   
   Get or set the Adaptive mesh control flag. If IADAPT=1, number of elements between
   initial (FILENAME2) and simulated blank (FILENAME3) meshes can be
   different, avoiding using sheet blank from the file ï¿½adapt.msh (set IOFLAG=1 in *CONTROL_ADAPTIVE) for the initial blank mesh.

.. py:property:: maxsize
   :type: float


   
   Get or set the The expected maximum change in initial blank size. It is used where the initial blank is not flat, and the curvature is large in the boundary region.

.. py:property:: referenc
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Flag to indicate trim curve projection to a reference surface (mesh):
   EQ.0: no projection.
   EQ.1: the trim curves will be projected to the reference surface.In addition, the mesh file for the reference surface is given in FILENAME4.

.. py:property:: filename1
   :type: Optional[str]


   
   Get or set the The following file names, FILENAME1~3 are for the option DEVELOPMENT:
   Target input file name. If a blank mesh is used, the keyword file must contain
   *NODE and *ELEMENT_SHELL; if blank boundary is used, the file
   must consist of *DEFINE_TARGET_BOUNDARY. Once defined, the target
   never needs to be changed in an iterative optimization loop.
