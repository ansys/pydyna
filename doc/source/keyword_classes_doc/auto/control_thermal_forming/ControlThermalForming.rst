.. py:property:: ptype
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Thermal problem type (see Remark 1 for determining the type of problem):
   EQ.0: linear problem
   EQ.1: nonlinear problem with material properties evaluated at
   the temperature of the gauss point
   EQ.2: nonlinear problem with material properties evaluated at
   the average temperature of the element.

.. py:property:: tsf
   :type: float


   
   Get or set the Thermal Speedup Factor. This factor multiplies all thermal
   parameters with units of time in the denominator (such as
   thermal conductivity and convection heat transfer coefficients). It
   is used to artificially scale the problem in time. For example, if
   the velocity of the stamping punch is artificially increased by
   1000, then set TSF = 1000 to scale the thermal parameters.

.. py:property:: thshel
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Thermal shell option:
   EQ.0: no temperature gradient is considered through the shell
   thickness.
   EQ.1: a temperature gradient is calculated through the shell    thickness.

       !! processed by numpydoc !!

.. py:property:: ithoff
   :type: int


   
   Get or set the Flag for offsetting thermal contact surfaces for thick thermal shells:
   EQ.0: no offset; if thickness is not included in the contact, the
   heat will be transferred between the mid-surfaces of the
   corresponding contact segments (shells).
   EQ.1: offsets are applied so that contact heat transfer is always
   between the outer surfaces of the contact segments (shells).

   EQ.2: nonsymmetric direct solver
   EQ.3: diagonal scaled conjugate gradient iterative (default)
   EQ.4: incomplete choleski conjugate gradient iterativeEQ.5: nonsymmetric diagonal scaled bi-conjugate gradient
   For SMP or MPP:
   EQ.11: direct solver
   EQ.12: diagonal scaling (default for MPP) conjugate gradient iterative
   EQ.13: symmetric Gauss-Siedel conjugate gradient iterative
   EQ.14: SSOR conjugate gradient iterative
   EQ.15: ILDLT0 (incomplete factorization) conjugate gradient iterative
   EQ.16: modified ILDLT0 (incomplete factorization) conjugate gradient iterative
