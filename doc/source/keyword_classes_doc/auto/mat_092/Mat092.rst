.. py:property:: aopt
   :type: Optional[float]


   
   Get or set the Material axes option (see MAT_‌OPTIONTROPIC_‌ELASTIC particularly the Material Directions section, for details). The fiber direction depends on this coordinate system (see Remark 1).
   EQ.0.0: Locally orthotropic with material axes determined by element nodes 1, 2,and 4, as with* DEFINE_COORDINATE_NODES.For shells only, the material axes are then rotated about the normal vector to the surface of the shell by the angle FANG on this keyword or BETA on the * ELEMENT_SHELL_{OPTION} input.
   EQ.1.0 : Locally orthotropic with material axes determined by a point, P, in spaceand the global location of the element center; this is the a - direction.This option is for solid elements only.
   EQ.2.0: Globally orthotropic with material axes determined by vectors defined below, as with* DEFINE_COORDINATE_VECTOR
   EQ.3.0 : Locally orthotropic material axes determined by a vector v and the normal vector to the plane of the element.The plane of a solid element is the midsurface between the inner surface and outer surface defined by the first four nodes and the last four nodes of the connectivity of the element, respectively.Thus, for solid elements, AOPT = 3 is only available for hexahedrons.a is determined by taking the cross product of v with the normal vector, b is determined by taking the cross product of the normal vector with a,and c is the normal vector.Then aand b are rotated about c by an angle BETA.BETA may be set in the keyword input for the element or with FANG on this keyword.Note that for solids, the material axes may be switched depending on the choice of MACF.The switch may occur before or after applying the angle rotation depending on the value of MACF.
   EQ.4.0 : Locally orthotropic in a cylindrical coordinate system with the material axes determined by a vector v,and an originating point, P, which define the centerline axis.This option is for solid elements only.
   LT.0.0 : The absolute value of AOPT is a coordinate system ID number(CID on * DEFINE_COORDINATE_OPTION).
