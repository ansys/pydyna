            - Get or set the Material identification. A unique number has to be used.

            - Get or set the Mass density.

            - Get or set the Young’s modulus. For MODEL = 0, E may affect contact stiffness but otherwise is not used.  The final slope of curve LCID determines the elastic stiffness for loading and unloading.  This slope is also used in the time step calculation. For MODEL = 1, E is really used as Young’s modulus in the material law

            - Get or set the Poisson's ratio.
          * - :py:attr:`~lcid`
            - Get or set the MODEL.EQ.0:      load curve ID defining yield stress as a function of volumetric strain,  (see Figure 0-1).
          * - :py:attr:`~tsc`
            - Get or set the Tensile stress cutoff (only for MODEL = 0). A nonzero, positive value is strongly recommended for realistic behavior.
          * - :py:attr:`~damp`
            - Get or set the Rate sensitivity via damping coefficient (.05 <  recommended value < .50). Only available for MODEL = 0.

.. py:property:: lcid
   :type: Optional[int]


   
   Get or set the MODEL.EQ.0:      load curve ID defining yield stress as a function of volumetric strain,  (see Figure 0-1).
   MODEL.EQ.1:     load curve or table ID.If a load curve ID is specified,
   then the load curve defines uniaxial yield stress as a function of equivalent plastic strain.If a table ID is specified,
   then each strain rate references a load curve ID that gives uniaxial yield stress as a function of equivalent plastic strain.
