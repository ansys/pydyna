Start PyDYNA solver server locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prerequisites
*************

Start server on Windows
+++++++++++++++++++++++

#. If you want to start the server on Windows,please ensure that you have installed the ANSYS locally.

Start server on Linux(Centos7)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. If you want to start the server on Linux,please ensure that you have installed the Open MPI package.

   .. code:: bash

       yum install openmpi3 openmpi3-dev

#. set environment variable for Open MPI

   .. code:: bash

       export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi3/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       export PATH=/usr/lib64/openmpi3/bin:$PATH

Run an example on the client side
*********************************
 
   .. code:: bash

       import ansys.dyna.core.solver as solver

       hostname = "localhost"
       port = "5000"
       dyna=solver.DynaSolver(hostname,port)     # connect to the server
       dyna.push("./output/ball_plate.k")        # push an input file
       dyna.start_locally(input = "ball_plate.k",nproc=1) 

#. The function of DynaSolver() can download and start the solver server automatically.
