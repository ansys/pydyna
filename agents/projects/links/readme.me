Only link id's are not sufficiently detailed to cover all linking situations. Some links reference to different keywords depending on another field "conditional links". This branch contains the "agent_reference_revised_manual_json". It holds for each field of a keyword that represents a link the keywords which it is linking to including linking conditions if they apply.

The json is partially generated with the copilot together with the indexed manual. Additonally I crosschecked for inconsistencies and resolved most of them. However there are still inconsistent link, by crosschecking with the manual it seems this is actually the case. There is a helper script check_link_dict.py in the branch that lists inconsistent links.

We should update to the most recent kwd.json as soon as possible before finalizing this link map. Some fields name changed.

Some comments on the inconsistent links below:

-11/-12 --> links are indeed inconsistent (checked with manual)
-2 --> some keywords still use the old master / slave convention. Probably a newer kwd.json will solve this. However those links will need to be updated manually
-3 --> are indeed inconsistent (checked with manual)
-7168 CONTROL_IMPLICIT_GENERAL_DYN / CONTROL_IMPLICIT_GENERAL_SPR CNSTN is not a link according to the manual…
137 consistent an SET_IGA_FACE but with different sub keywords _XYZ or _UVW
22 could probably be unified by using GT.0 --> DEFINE_VECTOR and LT.0 --> DEFINE_COORIDNATE
83 inconsistent in case of INITIAL_VOLUME_FRACTION_GEOMETRY
85 inconsistent in DEFINE_CPM_BAG_INTERACTION in fact very special as NSPEC does not reference 1 card 1 field but a certain line in a certain card of AIRBAG_PARTICLE
97 inconsistent link (checked with manual)
